<div class="about">

<h2>In Isolation, Magic is Borne</h2>
<p>For many hundreds of years, the Isle of Skye was isolated from the rest of Scotland. Settled by both Celts and Norse, and  the Picts before them, Skye became a Viking hot spot, like so many of the other Scottish Isles. Its isolation became more pronounced toward the Industrial Revolution. Life moved at a slower pace in Skye, and stories of fairies continued to be passed on orally. The Fay, the Brownies, and Giants all called the Isle of Skye home.</p>

<h2>An homage to the Fairy Pools of Skye</h2>

<p>The Fairy pools are a series of waterfalls, popular with hikers and “wild swimmers.” The pools are crystal clear and surrounded by large rocky cliffs and walls, waterfalls, and lush foliage. Check out our collection of creatures, and read about their unique traits, or add your own to our database.</p>
